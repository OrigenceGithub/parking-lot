# parking-lot

Goal: Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles. 

Here are a few methods that you should be able to run: 
- Tell us how many spots are remaining.
- Tell us how many total spots are in the parking lot.
- Tell us when the parking lot is full.
- Tell us when the parking lot is empty.
- Tell us if we can park a particular vehicle type.
- Tell us how many spots vans are taking up. 


Assertions: 
- The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans.
- A motorcycle can park in a single spot.
- A car can park in a single spot.
- A van can park, but it will take up 3 spots.
- You do not have to worry about the spots being continuous.
